* Notes

  - Aim is to provide a connector that can search remote Koha
    systems, ideally grouped, and place requests against any of
    those.

** Search

   - The search calls are implemented using Koha SRU server until
     REST APIs are available.  ILS-DI does not allow for searches.
     (example calls in [[file:sru-examples.client][rest file]])

** Place hold

   - This is implemented using the ILS-DI interface using a
     specialised patron at the server
   - We will need to perform two calls for this:
     - authentication
     - place hold
     - (example calls in [[file:sru-examples.client][rest file]])
   - We will authentication, limit checking, etc to the supplying
     server for now.
     - This means we have collective limits on number of ILLs for now

* Resources

  - I can use the PTFS demo server at https://demo{staff}.koha-ptfs.eu
    - It has ILS-DI enabled at https://demo.koha-ptfs.eu/cgi-bin/koha/ilsdi.pl
    - And SRU at http://demo.koha-ptfs.eu:9998/biblios
    - I have a test user, alex_library for ils-di hold requests
      - password in shroud, under ptfs.demo.koha-ptfs.eu.koha-ill-backend

* Backend dependencies

  - Catmandu::Importer::SRU

* Plan

** DONE [#A] Setup dev environment
   - Using Kohadevbox
   - Standard creation
   - Then copy (not symlink) Illbackends into ~/kohaclone/Koha
   - Created ILLLIBS organizational patron
   - Then edit koha-conf.xml at echo $KOHA_CONF
     - Paste ILL config section (copied from ~/kohaclone/etc/koha-conf.xml)
     - Edit Illbackends dir path
   - Enabled ILL module

** DONE [#A] Create Search interface

** DONE [#A] Create Request interface
